# USDC Git workshop

Welcome to USDC's Git workshop repository! This workshop aims to teach the following:

- Learning outcome #1
- Learning outcome #2
- Learning outcome #3

Prerequisites for this workshop: 

Feel free to complete the activities in this repository at whatever own order and pace feels right for you. We have included instructions below for optional guidance.

## 1. Create your own fork of this repository
Create a fork of the git-workshop repository (which can also be referred to as a "repo") using the Fork button on the upper right corner of this repo page.

In the owner dropdown, select your own GitHub username. You can keep the "Copy the main branch only" field checked.

This creates your own personal copy of the git-workshop repo on your GitHub account. Your changes on your forked repo will only be reflected in your personal GitHub account's version of the git-workshop code. Think of it as making your own copy of a Google doc. Your changes on your created copy will not change the original Google doc you copied.

## 2. Create a commit and publish a change directly to the main branch
The goal here is to familiarize ourselves with the commit and push mechanisms. When you are finished making edits to a file, the next step is to "commit" your changes. You can think of a commit as a photo snapshot of this project at a specific point in time. You can always refer to previous "commits" in your project's git timeline if you need to refer back to specific changes. 

You can create as many commits as you'd like, but if you want to publish these commits to GitHub you the next step is to "push" your changes. You can think of pushing a change as having a Google doc stored locally on your computer. After you've made some changes and you want to share these with your time, you'd upload the Google doc to Google Drive where its hosted online for others to view.
