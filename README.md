Feel free to complete the activities in this repository at whatever own order and pace feels right for you. We have included instructions below for optional guidance.

This creates your own personal copy of the git-workshop repo on your GitHub account. Your changes on your forked repo will only be reflected in your personal GitHub account's version of the git-workshop code. Think of it as making your own copy of a Google doc. Your changes on your created copy will not change the original Google doc you copied.
